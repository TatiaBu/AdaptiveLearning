### What is this repository for? ###

This repo manages the Adaptive Learning Task (EEG).
This task is used for investigating learning under uncertainty
in environments with systematic changes and random variability. 

### How do I get set up? ###

Just create a new project in your git client (or git itself). It's recommended to put the task in a folder in your MATLAB directory. There you should add a new folder "DataDirectory" which git currently ignores (otherwise every new dataset will require a commit).
